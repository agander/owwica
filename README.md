Oh What Was It Called Again
===========================

This facility will select all executables that match a string criteria. 

It gathers all executables from all the paths in your ${PATH} and then selects
those that match the parameter you supply.

e.g. ```owwica -s ch```

gives: -
```
/usr/bin/chmod
/usr/bin/chgrp
/usr/bin/chown
```
